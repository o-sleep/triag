Triangle Tag Game

# Description
This is an attempt to recreate a very simple but very fun
game from the 90s.  

It consists of a bunch of triangles that have different forms
of tagging each other with payload patterns.  Each triangle
can either be a computer bot or a player.  The players can
play on the same keyboard but since there are only 5 keys
needed, can be assigned different groups of keys (e.g. asdf
for player 1, arrow keys for player 2, etc.)
